## Iteration 0: Up and Running

Part of the reason Ruby on Rails became popular quickly is that it takes
a lot of the hard work off your hands, and that’s especially true in
starting up a project. Rails practices the idea of “sensible defaults”
and tries to, with one command, create a working application ready for
your customization.

### Setting the Stage

First we need to make sure everything is setup and installed. See the
[Environment
Setup](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html)
page for instructions on setting up and verifying your Ruby, Rails, and
add-ons.

#### Generate the Project

Let’s lay the groundwork for our project. In your terminal, switch to
the directory where you’d like your project to be stored. I’ll use
`~/projects`.

Run the `rails -v` command and you should see your current Rails
version. This tutorial was written with Rails **4.0.0**. Let’s create a new
Rails project:

{% terminal %}
$ rails new merchant
{% endterminal %}

Then `cd` into your project directory and open the project in your
editor of choice, I’ll use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) .

#### Booting the Server

Start it up with this instruction:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails server
{% endterminal %}

Then try loading the address
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000). You should see Rails’
“Welcome Aboard” page. Click the “About your application’s environment”
link and it’ll display the versions of all your installed components.

#### Scaffolding

Rails makes it really easy to begin modeling your data using
scaffolding.

We’ll start by thinking about a “product” in our store. What attributes
does a product have? What type of data are each of those attributes? We
don’t need to think of EVERYTHING up front, here’s a list to get us
started:

-   `title` which should be a `string`
-   `price` which should be an `decimal`
-   `description` which should be `text`
-   `image_url` which should be a `string`

Why make `price` an `decimal`? If you make it a regular float, you’re
going to run into mathematic inconsistencies later on. Prices aren’t
real floats because the number of places after the decimal don’t change
— it’s always two.

Ok, time to finally generate your scaffold. Enter this command:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate scaffold Product title:string price:decimal description:text image_url:string
{% endterminal %}

Reading that line out loud would sound like “run the generator named
`scaffold` and tell it to create an object named `Product` that
has a `title` that is a `string`, a `price` that is a `decimal`, a
`description` that is `text`, and a `image_url` that is a `string`”

The generator will then create about 30 files and directories for
you based on this information.

We need to add extra options to our `price` column. Modify the `price`
line in your freshly generated migration so it looks like this:

```ruby
t.decimal :price, precision: 8, scale: 2
```

We give it two additional options: the `precision` controls how many digits the
number can have in total. The `scale` controls how many digits come after the
decimal. So this column will have a maximum value of 999999.99, which would be
some expensive groceries.

Now you need to **run** this migration so it actually creates the
`products` table in the database.

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
{% endterminal %}

Technically, `RAILS_ENV=development` is redundant, because your rails environment already defaults to development.

You should see output explaining that it created the table named
`products`.

#### Setting Up Strong Parameters

Rails defaults to a “whitelist” security system to protect
application data from being mass-assigned. Mass assignment is
what happens any time we set more than one attribute at once (for
example, updating a Product’s title and price at the same time). There
are certain fields that you don’t want to be mass-assignable for
security reasons (e.g., we wouldn’t want an “admin” privilege to be
mass-assignable on user, otherwise we might have security bugs where a
user can elevate their own privileges).

The practical effect of this whitelist system is that we won’t be able
to mass-assign any properties of any of the Products in our application
until we remove that restriction. Since we used a generator to create the 
Product model we don't need to worry about setting the accessible attributes 
ourselves, but just to confirm that they have been added, take a look at
`app/controllers/products_controller.rb`, at the very bottom:

```ruby
# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:title, :price, :description, :image_url)
end
```

This tells Rails to allow all four of our Product attributes to be
mass-assign-able.

#### Creating Sample Products

Now, in your browser, go to
[http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products).

You should get a page that says “Listing Products”, click the “New Product” link
and it’ll bring up a very simple form. Enter the following data:

-   Title: Green Grapes (1 bunch)
-   Price: 2.00
-   Description: 1 bunch of approximately 80 green grapes.
-   Image\_url: green\_grapes.jpg

Click `Create`. If everything looks good on the next page, click the
`Back` link. Click the “New Product” link and enter the second product:

-   Title: Purple Grapes (1 bunch)
-   Price: 2.25
-   Description: 1 bunch of approximately 90 purple grapes.
-   Image\_url: purple\_grapes.jpg

Create it and look at your products listing. Now you have a web store!
(NOTE: The images will be missing for now, that’s ok!)

#### How does Rails do that?

Let’s take a peek at how this is all working. Browse your project files
and look at the following files:

-   `config/routes.rb`
    When you request a page from the application this is the first place
    Rails goes. See the line `resources :products`? Resources are things
    that follow the RESTful web conventions. For instance, if the router
    receives a GET request for `/products` it should look in the
    `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` for a method named `index`.
    After finding the `products` entry in the Routes file, Rails knows
    to come to this file and run the `index` method. You’ll see the
    `index` method like the code below. The second line is the most
    important — it reads “Find all the Products and stick them in the
    variable `@products`”.

```ruby
def index
  @products = Product.all
end
```

-   Now take a look at `app/views/products/index.html.erb`
    This is the view template which is responsible for creating the HTML
    sent to the browser. The template is written in a format named
    **ERB** which allows us to mix HTML and Ruby. The first few lines of
    this files just look like plain HTML. On line 10, though, you see
    some ERB syntax. Look at the example below. See the `<%` and `%>` in
    line 17? Those tags mark the beginning and end of Ruby code inside
    the ERB file. Basically they mean “evaluate whatever code is between
    these markers as though it were part of a Ruby program.” Then in
    line 19 you see a variation where the opening tag has an equals sign
    like this: `<%=`. When there is **no** equals sign, the code between
    the markers is run **silently**. When the beginning marker has the
    *equals sign*, erb will **output** the result of the code into the
    HTML.

```erb
<h1>Listing products</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Image url</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @products.each do |product| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= product.title %></td>
        <td><%= product.price %></td>
        <td><%= product.description %></td>
        <td><%= product.image_url %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(product) %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
```

Now you’ve got a database-driven web application running and Iteration 0
is complete.

## Iteration 1: Basic Product Listings

So now you might be impressed with yourself. You’ve got a web store just
about done, right? Real stores have a ton of **information** ...pictures,
data, reviews, categories not to mention the ability to actually **buy**
something. We’ll get there — for now let’s make our store look a little
more respectable.

#### Working with Layouts

In the first iteration I lied to you about how the view step works. When
you’re looking at the products listing, Rails isn’t just grabbing the
`index.html.erb`. It’s also looking in the `app/views/layouts/` folder
for a **layout** file. Expand that directory in your editor and you’ll
see that the scaffold generator created a file named
`application.html.erb` for us.

You can think of a layout like a wrapper that is put around each of your
view templates. Layouts allow us to put all the common HTML in one place
and have it used by all our view templates. For instance, it’d be a pain
to have to write out the whole `<head>` section in each of our ERB
templates. Open the layout file and you’ll see a lot of the HTML
framework is already in the layout file.

If you’re on Amazon each of their pages has a certain look and feel.
They have common navigation, stylesheets, titling, etc. The layout is
where we take care of these common elements. In the `<head>` section of
the layout it currently has line with a `<title>` — change it so it
reads like this:

```erb
<title>FoodWorks - Products: <%= controller.action_name %></title>
```

Hit save, switch back to your browser with the product listing, and hit
refresh. The title of your browser tab should now say “FoodWorks –
Products: index”. Then click the `New product` link. The window title
should now say “FoodWorks – Products: new”. Even though the `index` and
`new` actions have different view templates they share the same layout,
so the change we made shows up in both places. Let’s add a little more
to the layout file…

-   Download that stylesheet
    ([styles.css](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/assets/merchant/styles.css))
    and put it into your project’s `app/assets/stylesheets/` folder.
-   Next let’s add a little structure to our pages to make CSS styling
    easier. Check out your application layout at `app/views/layout/application.html.erb` and modify everything from `<body>` to `</body>` so it matches
    the code below:

```erb
<body>
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="header">
      <h1>FoodWorks</h1>
      <p>Your Online Grocery</p>
    </div>

    <p style="color: green"><%= flash[:notice] %></p>

    <div class="sidebar">
      (sidebar)
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <%= yield %>
    </div>

    <div class="footer">
      FoodWorks Online Grocery<br/>
      A Rails Jumpstart Project
    </div>
</div>
</body>
```

Now save your layout and refresh the products listing. It should look a
little prettier, but we haven’t changed much about the content yet.

#### Editing a View Template

Let’s open the `app/views/products/index.html.erb` view template so we
can make some changes.

-   Change the title to H1 tags with the text “All Products”
-   The link at the bottom is currently “New product” — let’s change it
    to “Create a New Product” like this:

```erb
<p><%= link_to "Create a New Product", new_product_path, id: "new_product" %></p>
```

-   Then let’s restructure the table.
     See the line that says `<% @products.each do |product| %>`? That means
    “for each of the things in the variable `@products`, take them one
    at a time, call them `product`, then do everything in between this
    line and the one that reads `<% end %>`”
    So for each `product`, the existing template creates one TD for the
    `title`, one for the `price`, one for the `description` and so on.
    Let’s simplify the products like this:

```erb
<% @products.each do |product| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= image_tag "products/#{product.image_url}" %></td>
    <td><span class="product_title"><%= product.title %></span><%= product.description %></td>
    <td><%= product.price %></td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
```

Try looking at the page in your web browser. Rework the table’s THs to
match up with the new TDs.

Download the sample images for products here:
[products.zip](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/assets/merchant/products.zip).
Move the images into `app/assets/images/products/`.

Save that and check out your products index at
[http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products).

#### Fixing the Price Display

When you look at the products index the price is a little ambiguous. It
doesn’t have a currency marker. Let’s clean it up with a view helper.

A helper, in Rails, is code that helps you manipulate data as part of
the presentation. We want to make a helper where we can send in a number
like “2.25” and it gives us back “$2.25”, the format our shoppers are
anticipating.

-   Open the file `app/helpers/products_helper.rb`
-   Between the line that starts with `module` and the `end`, add this
    method:

```ruby
def print_price(price)
  "$#{price}"
end
```

Go back to your `index.html.erb` file and change `<%= product.price %>`
to `<%= print_price(product.price) %>`. Save it and refresh your
products display. Notice anything?

If you have a price that ends in a zero, like your Green Grapes at
$2.00, you’ll see that the trailing zeros are being cutoff. That’s no
good.

Look at your `print_price` helper again. What’s the right fix? One
approach is to use the `format` method in Ruby like this:

```ruby
def print_price(price)
  format("$%.2f", price)
end
```

That works great, check it out in your browser. The only objection is
that it doesn’t internationalize. When we want to start selling
groceries in the EU, we’ll need to rewrite this code.

Rails has a built-in helper method for exactly this purpose named
`number_to_currency`. Its full description is here:
[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/NumberHelper.html\#method-i-number\_to\_currency](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/NumberHelper.html#method-i-number_to_currency)

We can use it just like this:

```ruby
def print_price(price)
  number_to_currency price
end
```

Check out the results in your browser; your store is starting to look
good!

#### Linking to the Product Page

When you’re on the index page there’s no way to get to the “show” page
for an individual product. Go back to the `index.html.erb` and use the
`link_to` helper to insert links to the show page. `link_to` requires
two parameters: what the link should **say** and where it should
**point**. To trigger a show action, point the link towards
`product_path(product)`.

#### Working on the New Product Page

Click the `Create a New Product` link on your index page. Rails will
access your `products_controller`, find the `new` method, run that code,
then load the `new.html.erb` view template. Open that ERB file and
you’ll see there isn’t much there.

Change the title to an H1 that reads “Create a New Product.” Then to
manipulate the form itself we’ll need to jump into `_form.html.erb`.

-   Look at the line `<%= f.label :price %><br />`. This tells Rails to
    create an HTML `label` for the thing named `:price` and, by default,
    it puts the text `Price` there. We want it to say “Price (like
    2.99)” instead. We add in the desired text as a second parameter
    like this: `<%= f.label :price, "Price (like 2.99)" %><br />`
-   Save your ERB and reload your form to make sure everything is
    looking ok

Create a new product and enter in this information EXACTLY:

-   Title: Oranges
-   Price: $2.99
-   Description: Bag of 6 Valencia oranges.
-   Image\_url: oranges.jpg

Click `Create` then look at the page you get back.

#### Validating the Price

What’s up with the price? Is that what you expected?

We tried to put “$2.99” to the database, but it’s expecting a number,
not something with a dollar sign and a period. How does it end up with
$0?

The data is coming in from our form as a string, then Rails is trying to
coerce it into a decimal. Open `bin/rails console` and try calling
`"$2.99".to_f` to convert it to a float. This is similar to the coercion
that happens when we convert it to a decimal. We get zero!

How can we help the user not make this mistake? Adding a validation.

-   Open the file `app/models/product.rb`
-   Before the class’ `end`, add this validation:
    `validates_numericality_of :price`
-   Get back to your product listing and `destroy` the oranges that we
    just created
-   Click `Create a New Product` and enter the orange information just
    as we did above and click `Create`

Now you should see some great things that Rails does for “free”. It
keeps us on the product creation screen, it tells us that there was a
problem, it tells us what the problem is, then it highlights both the
label and the form field in red. Makes it pretty clear, right? Take off
the dollar sign so your price just says “2.99” and click `Create` again.

This is an opportunity to make things easier on our users. Typing a
dollar sign in the price is perfectly reasonable from their perspective.
We can handle it transparently on the server side.

When the form is being processed it passed the hash of values from the
form to `Product.new`. ActiveRecord then goes through the values in that
hash and stores them into the new record. It doesn’t directly manipulate
the object’s attributes, it uses setter methods kind of like this:

```ruby
def price=(input)
  self.price = input
end
```

We don’t see that method in our code because ActiveRecord generates it
on the fly at load time. But we can override the method if we want to do
something special, like delete a dollar sign:

```ruby
def price=(input)
  input.delete!("$")
  super
end
```

The first line does an in-place delete (`delete!` as opposed to
`delete`), removing any dollar signs. Then, with the value changed,
`super` invokes the original `price=` method.

Try it out in your console and browser. Set prices like “2.99” and
“$3.99” — they should both work as expected.

Now, go ahead and create a few more sample products. Look at the folder
of images that you copied over to see what’s available. Make at least 5
products for your store.

Iteration 1 is complete!

## Iteration 2: Handling Stock

Any good store needs to manage stock. When customers are shopping they
should be able to see the current stock. When people buy something, the
stock goes down. Administrators should be able to arbitrarily change the
stock count.

#### Modifying the Database

Anytime we’re tracking new data we’ll need to modify the database. Jump
over to your Terminal and generate a migration with this command:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate migration add_stock_to_products
{% endterminal %}

After it generates, open the migration (look in `db/migrate`) and in
the `change` add the line below.

```ruby
add_column :products, :stock, :integer, default: 0
```

Run the migration with `bin/rake db:migrate` then the column exists in your
database.

#### Adding to the Products Listing

Let’s open up the view for our products index
(`app/views/products/index.html.erb`) and add in a column after `Price`
for `Stock` in the THs. Down in the TDs, write this:

```erb
<td><%= print_stock(product.stock) %></td>
```

So that’s expecting to use the helper method named `print_stock`. Here’s
the logic we want to implement:

-   If the product is in stock, print the following where ## is the
    number in stock:
    -   `<span class="in_stock">In Stock (##)</span>`
-   If it’s out of stock, print the following:
    -   `<span class="out_stock">Out of Stock</span>`

Go into the `products_helper.rb` and create a method named `print_stock`
then fill in the blank lines with the stock messages:

```ruby
def print_stock(stock)
  if stock > 0

  else

  end
end
```

*Hint:* check out the `content_tag` method
(http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TagHelper.html#method-i-content_tag)

With the helper implemented refresh your products index and you should
see all products out of stock.

#### Making the Stock Editable

Hop into the show page for your first project then click the `Edit`
link.

This edit form only shows the original fields that were there when we
ran the scaffold generation, but it’s easy to add in our stock. Open the
form template at `app/views/products/_form.html.erb`

Using the title and price as examples, write a paragraph for the stock
including the label and a text field. Refresh your web browser and you
should see the stock field available for editing.

Since it’s just a raw text field, let’s add some validation to the
`product.rb` model to make sure we don’t put something crazy in for the
stock. Check out the [Rails Guide on
Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)
and figure out how to write ONE validation that makes sure:

- stock is a number
- stock is an integer
- stock is greater than or equal to zero

Once your validation is implemented, give it a try with illegal values
for `Stock` like `-50`, `hello!`, and `5.5`. Is it failing?

#### Dealing with Strong Parameters

Your validation probably isn’t working, right? Your form isn’t changing
the value of stock, but it also isn’t showing a validation error. What’s
up?

Take a look in the `ProductsController` again. Unless you anticipated this
problem and fixed it already, `stock` will not be in your
`product_params` permitted list, and that would stop you from being able to
submit an adjustment to `stock` via the form.

Add `stock` to the `permit` list and retry your good and bad stock values.

```ruby
def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:title, :price, :description, :image_url, :stock)
end
```

With those validations implemented, add stock to most of your products
so we can do some shopping.

Iteration 2 is complete!

## Iteration 3: Designing Orders

We’ve got products, but until we have a way to create orders then our
store isn’t going to make any money.

### Brainstorming the Data Structure

Let’s think about what an “order” is:

-   It’s a collection of products to purchase
    -   Each of those has a quantity and a unit price
-   It has a total price
-   It has a customer
-   It has a status like “unsubmitted”, “needs\_payment”,
    “needs\_packing”, “needs\_shipping”, and “shipped”

Looking at this from the database perspective, we’ll need two objects:

-   `OrderItem`
    One piece of an order, this will be a single product ID and a
    quantity of how many are being ordered
    -   `product_id`: (integer) the `Product` that this `OrderItem` is
        referencing
    -   `order_id`: (integer) the `Order` that this `OrderItem` is
        referencing
    -   `quantity`: (integer) the quantity of this product desired
-   `Order`
    It will have many `OrderItem` objects, belong to a customer ID, and
    have a status code
    -   `user_id`: (integer) the user that this order belongs to
    -   `status`: (string) the current status of the order

With that in mind, go to your Terminal and generate some scaffolding and
migrate the database:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate scaffold OrderItem product_id:integer order_id:integer quantity:integer
$ bin/rails generate scaffold Order user_id:integer status:string
$ bin/rake db:migrate
{% endterminal %}

### The Data Models

From there we need to build up our two data models and express their
relationships.

#### The `OrderItem` Model

Jump into `app/models/order_item.rb` and we’ll work on relationships.
Since the `OrderItem` holds a foreign key referencing an `Order`, we’d
say that that it `belongs_to` the `Order`. Add the relationship to the
model like this:

```ruby
class OrderItem < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :order
end
```

There’s also a relationship between an `OrderItem` and a `Product`. A
`Product` is going to be ordered many times, we hope, but an `OrderItem`
is only going to connect with a single `Product`. This is a
“One-to-Many” relationship where one `Product` is going to have many
`OrderItems` and an `OrderItem` is going to `belong_to` a product.

Add the second `belongs_to` relationship in `order_item.rb`

Then, add a validation to make sure that no `OrderItem` gets
created without an `order_id` and a `product_id`.

#### The `Order` Model

Next, let’s turn our attention to `app/models/order.rb` . We said
previously that an `OrderItem` would `belong_to` an `Order`. We definitely
want people ordering as many products as they want, so an `Order` should have
many `OrderItems`. Add it like this:

```ruby
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :order_items
end
```

#### Products to Order Items

We won’t actually need it for our application, but as long as a
`Product` is related to an `OrderItem`, you should go ahead and add the
`has_many` association in `product.rb`.

### Implementing an Order Workflow

That was the easy part. Now it’s going to get tricky.

#### Add to Cart Links

Let’s open the `index` view for our `products`
(`app/views/products/index.html.erb`). How do we want the shopping
process to work? Each product description should have an “Add to Cart”
link that adds that item to the customer’s cart. Once they click that
the customer should be taken to their order screen where they can set
quantities and checkout.

First we’ll create the “Add to Cart” link. In the `<th>` lines near the
top of the index add `<th>Buy</th>`. Then in the TDs, underneath the
stock line, let’s add a new cell:

```erb
<td><%= link_to "Add to Cart", new_order_item_path(product_id: product.id) %></td>
```

This says "create a link with the text ‘Add to Cart’ which links to the
new `order_item` path and sends in a parameter named `product.id` with
the value of the ID for this `product`.

Reload the index in your browser and you new link should show up.

#### Tracking an Order

When you click the “Add to Cart” link you see a plain scaffolding form
prompting the user for the product id, order id, and quantity. That’s
not acceptable.

When the user clicks “Add to Cart”, the system should:

-   Find or create a new `Order` for the current visitor
-   Add the item to the `Order` with a quantity 1

The first part is tricky because HTTP is a stateless protocol. There
isn’t any continuity between requests, so it’s hard to identify a user.
But in situations like this one, we need to keep track of users across
many page clicks.

We’ll take advantage of Rails’ session management here. The session will
allow us to track data about a user across multiple requests.

#### Managing Orders in a Before Filter

Open your `app/controllers/order_items_controller.rb` file. This
controller is what handles the “operations” of a web request. The
request starts at the router (the `config/routes.rb` file), gets sent to the
correct controller, then the controller interacts with the models and
views. Think of the controller as the “coach” — it calls all the shots.
At the top of the controller file, just below the `class` line, add this
code:

```ruby
before_action :load_order, only: [:create]
```

We’re declaring a `before_action`. This tells Rails “before every request to
this controller, run the method named `load_order`”. The `only: [:create]`
part tells rails only to run this method before calls to the create action. If
we didn't include the `only: [:create]` parameter then the `load_order` method
would be called before every action in the `order_items` controller.

If you think about it, it doesn't really make sense for us to call the
`load_order` method before every action; we only need to call it before we add
a new order item.

We need to define the method named `load_order`. At the bottom of the same
file, below the line that says `private` add the following:

```ruby
def load_order
  begin
    @order = Order.find(session[:order_id])
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    @order = Order.create(status: "unsubmitted")
    session[:order_id] = @order.id
  end
end
```

Rails provides us access to the user session through the `session` hash. This
method tries to find the `Order` with the `:order_id` in the session and
stores it into the variable named `@order`. If the `session` hash does not
have a key named `:order_id` or the order has been destroyed, Rails will raise
an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` error. The `rescue` statement watches for
this error and, if it occurs, creates a new `Order`, stores it into the
variable `@order`, and saves the ID number into `session[:order_id]`.

With that code in place refresh your Products index and... nothing looks
different.

That's because nothing happened. The `load_order` method gets called when we
hit `POST /products`, but we've been hitting `GET /products/new`.

We could change the link so that it tricks Rails into accepting a POST, but
it's generally cleaner to just create a form. That way search spiders and
other internet bots won't create carts willy-nilly.

Replace the _Add to Cart_ link with this:

```erb
<td><%= button_to "Add to Cart", order_items_path(product_id: product.id) %></td>
```

Reload the index page, and click the _Add to Cart_ button. The page blows up,
complaining about not finding a parameter:

```plain
param not found: order_item
```

That's because the form that gets created by the `button_to` helper doesn't
nest data in an `order_item` hash, it simply submits to the URL provided.

We need to update the `create` action in the OrderItemsController. Change
this:

```ruby
def create
  @order_item = OrderItem.new(order_item_params)
  # ...
end
```

to this:

```ruby
def create
  @order_item = OrderItem.new(product_id: params[:product_id])
  # ...
end
```

If you refresh the index page and click _Add to Cart_ you'll end up on the
[new page for the order item](http://localhost:3000/order_items/new) with a
complaint that you're missing the order_id.

We have the order stored in an instance variable. Let's use that.

```ruby
def create
  @order_item = OrderItem.new(product_id: params[:product_id], order_id: @order.id)
  # ...
end
```

Now if you click the add to cart button, you will end up on the Order Item's
show page.

It would be more helpful to go to the order page. In the `create` action
of the order items controller change the response for HTML to redirect to the
order:

```ruby
format.html { redirect_to @order, notice: 'Successfully added product to cart.' }
```

Try adding a product to your cart again.

#### Improving `load_order`

In general we should avoid using exceptions for control flow. Our
implementation of `load_order` is expecting an exception to be raised
under a somewhat normal circumstance: a new user arrives on the site. We
should redesign this method to not rely on `begin`/`rescue`/`end`.

`ActiveRecord` provides us with dynamic finders and initializers for all
our models. For a `Product`, we can do any of the following:

```ruby
Product.find 2
Product.find_by_title "Green Grapes"
Product.find_by_image_url "purple_grapes.jpg"
```

We can call a class method `find_by_` then give it the name of any model
attribute to search for a match. We can also use `find_all_by_` to fetch
an array of all matches.

How does that help us here? Well, Rails takes it a step further:

```ruby
Product.find_or_initialize_by_id(5)
Product.find_or_initialize_by_title "Apples"
```

The `find_or_initialize_by` method will first attempt to find a match
in the database for the specified attribute and value. If it finds one,
that object will be returned. If it **doesn’t** find a match, it will
build one in memory and return the new object.

This object will not yet have been saved to the database. If we wanted
to build it and save it in one step, we could use `find_or_create_by`.
Returning to our `load_order` method, we can implement the technique
like this:

```ruby
def load_order
  @order = Order.find_or_initialize_by(id: session[:order_id], status: "unsubmitted")
  if @order.new_record?
    @order.save!
    session[:order_id] = @order.id
  end
end
```

Note that the `status: "unsubmitted"` will only set the `status` if it
is initializing a new object, it will not change the value of records
found in the database.

From there we look to see if it is a `new_record?`, which is true when
the record has not yet been stored to the DB. If it is new, save it to
the DB so it gets an ID, the store that ID into the user’s `session`.

#### Cleaning up

We don't use the new form. Let's get rid of the `new` action in the
controller. While we’re cutting code, we won’t need the `show` or `index`
actions either, so delete them.

#### Rewriting the Create Action

Look at the server log for the last request. You should see “Started
POST” then look at the parameters line. See the `product_id` in there?
We have all the information we need to rewrite the `create` action. The
`create` currently looks like this:

```ruby
def create
  @order_item = OrderItem.new(product_id: params[:product_id], order_id: @order.id)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @order_item.save
      format.html { redirect_to @order, notice: 'Successfully added product to cart.' }
      format.json { render action: 'show', status: :created, location: @order_item }
    else
      format.html { render action: 'new' }
      format.json { render json: @order_item.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

#### Building the `OrderItem`

We can build the `order_item` through the relationship with the order like this:

```ruby
def create
  @order_item = @order.order_items.new(quantity: 1, product_id: params[:product_id])
  # ...
end
```

The `order_id` will be set by the relationship, then we explicitly set
the `quantity` to one and the `product_id` comes from the request
parameters.

Go back to your products `index` page, click an “Add to Cart” button.

### Displaying an Order

You should now be redirected to
[http://localhost:3000/orders/1](http://localhost:3000/orders/1) which is your
current order. You’re looking at the order, you think some products have been
added, but we’re not doing anything to display them yet.

Add this snippet somewhere on the page:

```erb
<p>
  Item Count: <%= @order.order_items.count %>
</p>
```

Reload the page and you should see the **Item Count** display 1. Go back
to your products listing and click “Add to Cart” to add more items. You
should see this counter increasing each time.

Our shopping experience has a long way to go, but it’s getting there.

Iteration 3 is complete!

## Iteration 4: Improving the Orders Interface

We’ll continue working on our `app/views/orders/show.html.erb` so open
it in your editor and load an order in your web browser.

### Reworking the Order’s `show` View

Replace the code in the `show.html.erb` with this:

```erb
<h1>Your Order</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Customer</th>
    <td><%= @order.user_id %></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Status:</th>
    <td><%= @order.status %></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Items:</th>
    <td><%= @order.order_items.count %></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Items</th>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Quantity</th>
    <th>Unit Price</th>
    <th>Subtotal</th>
  </tr>
  <!-- more code will go here -->
</table>
```

Save that then refresh your order view. The basics are there, but it
still isn’t showing what items are in the order.

#### Displaying Individual Items in an Order

Remember when we declared that an `Order` `has_many` `OrderItems`? We
did that so we could easily access an order’s items. Remove the line
that says `<!-- more code will go here -->` and replace it with this:

```erb
<% @order.order_items.each do |item| %>

<% end %>
```

Inside those lines put the HTML and data you want rendered for
`each` item in the `@order`. Follow the headings that already exist.
You’ll need to create a new `TR` that contains...

-   A blank TD
-   The `item.product.title` in a TD
-   The `item.quantity` in a TD
-   The `item.product.price` in a TD and use the `print_price` helper
-   A blank TD, temporarily, for the subtotal

Refresh your view and you should see your individual `OrderItems` listed
out.

#### Displaying Product Images

Integrate images of the products into your order display into the first
TD of the row. As you did in the products listing, the image can be
inserted by using Rails’ `image_tag` helper method along with the path
to the image (which the `Product` model stores). Try and figure this out
on your own, but if necessary go look at your
`app/views/products/index.html.erb` file.

### Order Calculations

We need to both calculate the subtotals for individual items and the
total cost for the entire order.

#### `OrderItem` Subtotal

The subtotal is the easier part because it only involves one object, the
`OrderItem`. We can ask an `OrderItem` to output its subtotal like this:

```erb
<%= print_price item.subtotal %>
```

If you refresh that will crash because it’s expecting `item` to have a
method named `subtotal`. Open the `OrderItem` model and define a method
named `subtotal` that returns the quantity times the product’s price.

When you think you’ve got it, refresh the view and check out your
results. It’s not very convincing since our quantities are all 1 right
now, but it’s a start.

#### Calculating the Order Total

Now we’re displaying the individual items and their costs, but we don’t
have a total for the order. Let’s open the `Order` model
(`app/models/order.rb`) and create a method named `total`. Our
`OrderItem` model already implements a `subtotal` method that gives us
the total for that single item, so what we need to do is add up the
`subtotal` from each of the `order_items` in this order.

I’m going to leave that up to you.

With that method written, go back to your order’s `show` view and add
another line at the bottom with a TH that says “Order Total” and a TD
that displays the total. Remember to use your `print_price` helper
method to get the right formatting.

### Manipulating the Order

We can add items to the order, but we can’t remove them.

#### Removing a Single Item from the Order

Let’s add a “remove” link for each item in the order.

Removing a single item from the order is actually pretty easy. To get a
hint, let’s look at some scaffolding views that we aren’t actually
using. Open up `app/views/order_items/index.html.erb`. See how it makes
the “Destroy” link? Let’s grab that whole line.

Move back to your order’s `show` template go to the area where you’re
displaying the individual order items. Modify your table to make an
appropriate space for a “remove” link and paste in the code we got from
the other template. You can change the word “Destroy” to “Remove” be
less dramatic. Also change `order_item` to `item`, since that’s what we
called it in that view’s `each` block.

Click one of the delete links and it almost works. The `destroy` action
in `OrderItemsController` is being triggered, but after destroying the
object it redirects to the `index` of `OrderItemsController`. Instead,
make it redirect to the order, then go back and try deleting another
item.

#### Clearing All Items from an Order

Deleting a single item was easy, but deleting all of them? We have two
options:

1.  Create a custom `empty` action in `OrdersController` and have it
    loop through destroying the individual `OrderItems`
2.  Just destroy the Order

I like easy, so let’s pick #2!

On the `show` view for your `Order`, add a link like this:

```erb
<%= link_to "Empty Cart", @order, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' }, method: :delete %>
```

Hop into the `destroy` action of `OrdersController` and change the
redirect so it sends you back to `products_path`.

Then give it a try.

#### Destroying `OrderItem` Records

If you go to “http://localhost:3000/order\_items/” you’ll see all the
`OrderItem` records stored in the database. Go to your console and erase
all the existing `Order` objects:

{% irb %}
$ Order.destroy_all
{% endirb %}

Refresh the `OrderItem` listing and... they’re all still there? If an
`Order` gets destroyed then we want the `OrderItem` objects to go too!

Go into `Order` model. Change the `has_many :order_items` line to this:

```ruby
has_many :order_items, dependent: :destroy
```

Now, when an `Order` is destroyed all the associated order items will
get destroyed too. This does **not** remove the `OrderItem` objects that
are already orphaned in the database. Kill those through the console:

{% irb %}
$ OrderItem.destroy_all
{% endirb %}

Then, through the web interface, add a few items to a new `Order`.
Destroy that `Order`, and check that the associated items are gone too.
When it works, Iteration 4 is complete!

## Iteration 5: Dealing with Order Quantities

Our order screen is getting powerful, but there are still some features
we should add around managing quantities.

#### No Double-Items

I’m sure you noticed that new order items are getting added to the cart
each time the user click “Add to Cart”. We don’t want two listings for
Green Grapes, we want one `order_item` with a quantity of two. No
problem!

This is how it should work:

-   When the user clicks the Add to Cart button...
    -   If that product is already in the order, increase the quantity
        by one
    -   If it’s not in the order, add it to the order with quantity one

Look at the `create` method in your `order_items_controller`. The first
line is always creating a new `OrderItem`, but we want to look for one
with the matching `product_id` first. We could do this ourselves with
and `if` statement, but let’s take advantage of Rails’
`find_or_initialize_by` like this:

```ruby
@order_item = @order.order_items.find_or_initialize_by_product_id(params[:product_id])
```

We can give `find_or_initialize_by` any attribute name of the object, in
this case `product_id`, and pass in the `product_id` we’re looking for.
If there is a matching `OrderItem` already attached to this `Order` with
this `product_id`, it’ll find it and give it back to us. If it doesn’t
exist, one will be created.

Try using this in your browser. As you add products to your cart you
should see that items to not get repeated, but the quantity is not yet
going up when we add the same product twice.

Empty your cart, and add a new item. Now it blows up because the item doesn't
have a quantity at all.

#### Incrementing Repeated Items

If the finder is creating a new `OrderItem`, we want to set the quantity
to 1. If it finds an existing `OrderItem`, we want to just increment it
by one. We can do both of these in one instruction **if** the default
`OrderItem` quantity is zero.

We set the default value in the database, and to change the database
we’ll need a migration. From your command line:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate migration add_default_quantity_to_order_items
{% endterminal %}

Then open that migration and in the `change` method add this line:

```ruby
change_column :order_items, :quantity, :integer, default: 0
```

Run the migration with `bin/rake db:migrate`. If you’d like to see the results,
create a new `OrderItem` from your console and you’ll see it starts with the
quantity 0.

Now that the default value is set, your `create` action in
`OrderItemsController` is easy. If it’s incrementing an existing item,
then we add one to the existing value. If it’s a new record, we want to
increment the counter from zero to one. Since zero is the existing value
of a new record, we can simply add one to the quantity and not care if
it’s a new record or an existing one.

Add a line to your `create` action that adds one to the order item’s
quantity before the `.save` is called.

Try adding an item to your cart multiple times and you should see the
quantities, subtotal, and total moving up!

### Managing Quantities in the Order

We never made a way for customers to easily modify the quantity of each
item in the order. Let’s implement that now. There are several ways we
could do this from an interface perspective. We’ll implement an easy
one.

Look at the `show` template for the `order`. Find the TD where we
currently just print out the quantity for that item. Let’s change it to
a link like this:

```erb
<td><%= link_to item.quantity, edit_order_item_path(item) %></td>
```

That says “create a link with the text of the link displaying the item’s
quantity and the link pointing to the `edit_order_item` action and tell
it that we want to edit the item named `item`”.

Save and refresh your browser. Click one of the resulting links under
quantity.

#### Cleaning Up the Order Items Edit

You are back to some ugly scaffolding code and this form is way too
flexible. We don’t want people changing the product ID or the order ID,
just the quantity. Open the `form` partial for `order_item`
(`app/views/order_items/_form.html.erb`) and make the following
changes:

-   Remove the `label` and `text_field` for `product_id` and, instead,
    just print out the product’s title
-   Remove the whole section for the `order_id`. It doesn’t need to be
    displayed or editable.

Refresh your page and make sure the form is displaying properly. Enter
the quantity desired as `5` then click Update.

It worked, kind of. It saved the new quantity, but the controller tries
to bounce you to the `show` template for `order_item`. What we’d really
like is to bounce back to the `show` for the `order`. Open up
`app/controllers/order_items_controller.rb`. Scroll down to the
`update` method, and change the `redirect_to` so it points to the order.

Go through and try changing the quantity again and you should return to
the order with the updated quantities.

#### Remove Items with 0 Quantity

Sometimes instead of clicking “remove” to remove an item from an order,
users will set the quantity to zero. Try doing this now with one of your
existing orders. What happens?

To tell you the truth, I expected an error.

We put in a validation that `order_item` couldn’t have a zero or negative
quantity because that wouldn’t make any sense — right? Right? Nope, missed it.

Open up your `app/models/order_item.rb` and add a validation that ensures
`quantity` is a number, an integer, and greater than zero.

Now go back to your order screen, edit an item’s quantity to zero, then
click update. You should get an error message sending you back to the
edit form saying that `quantity` must be greater than zero. This is good
for our data integrity, but ugly for our users.

Now look at `app/controllers/order_items_controller.rb` and
specifically the `update` method. We want to short-circuit this process
if the incoming `params[:order_item][:quantity]` is zero.

Restructure the logic with a conditional statement like this:

-   find the `order_item` by the `id`
-   if `params[:order_item][:quantity].to_i` is equal to zero
    -   destroy the `order_item`
    -   redirect to the order and set the `flash` to say that the item
        was removed

-   elsif the attributes successfully update…
    -   redirect to the `Order` with a notice
        `"Successfully updated the order item"`

-   else
    -   display the edit form again

Now that we're finding the order item in the update action, we no longer want
to run the `before_action`:

Remove `:update` from the list:

```ruby
before_action :set_order_item, only: [:show, :edit, :destroy]
```

Now if you update an items quantity to zero you shouldn't get an error and
the item will be removed.

Test it out and confirm that setting the quantity to zero removes an
item from the order.

### More Intelligent Stock Checking

Now that we can make all these changes to the quantity being ordered it
makes our current stock checking ineffective. If there’s at least one of
an item in stock, our app will say it’s “in stock”. But if the customer
is trying to order more than the current stock, we should change that
notification.

#### Displaying Stock on the Order Page

Let’s start by opening the `app/helpers/products_helper.rb` file and
finding the `print_stock` method we created earlier. We want to create
logic like this:

-   if there are none of the items in stock
    - return the “out of stock” line

-   else if there is enough stock to fulfill the requested number
    -   return the “in stock” line

-   else if there is some stock, but not enough to fulfill the requested
    number
    -   return this:
        `content_tag(:span, "Insufficient stock (#{stock})", class: "low_stock")`

But how will the helper know what quantity the current order is
requesting? We’ll have to add a second parameter. So change

```ruby
def print_stock(stock)
```

to...

```ruby
def print_stock(stock, requested)
```

Then use the `requested` variable to implement the logic above.

Go back to your your `show` view template for `orders`
(`app/views/orders/show.html.erb`). Try to add in a column to the
display that prints out the stock status of each of the items in the
order. Here are the steps you need to do:

-   Add the header for `Stock` between `Quantity` and `Unit Price`
-   Add the TD that calls the helper method `print_stock` and passes in
    the value of this item’s product’s stock and the quantity requested
    from this `order_item`

Refresh your browser and confirm that it’s working. Try setting your
quantities to trigger the “Insufficient Stock” message.

#### Displaying Stock on the Products Index

Now go back to your Products listing page. Problem? Your products
listing is also trying to use that `print_stock` helper, but it’s just
sending in one parameter. Now we’re getting the error message that the
method is expecting two parameters. How to fix it? There are two ways.

The ugly way would be to open the products `index` view and change our
call to the helper, adding in a `0` for the number requested. That’d
work, but we don’t like ugly. If we end up using the helper anywhere
else, we’d have to remember to always put in this hack.

Instead we’ll improve the helper, so switch back to that file. Ruby has
a great way of implementing optional parameters. We can set it up so
calling the helper with one parameter will print whether or not the item
is in stock, and sending in two parameters will check if there’s
sufficient stock. All we need to do is change...

```ruby
def print_stock(stock, requested)
```

to...

```ruby
def print_stock(stock, requested = 1)
```

With that change, if we send in a value for `requested` the method will
use it. If we don’t send in a value for `requested`, and thus have only
one parameter, it’ll just set requested to one. This will allow our
product listing to work just like it did before and our order page to
have the smarter sufficient-quantity check.

Test it out and, when it works, we’re done with iteration 5!

## Iteration 6: Establishing Identity

What’s the point of a web application if only one person can use it?
Let’s make our system support multiple users. There are three pieces to
making this happen:

-   **Authentication** – Establish identity
-   **Ownership** – Attach data records to user records
-   **Authorization** – Control who is allowed to do what

### Background on Authentication

There have been about a dozen popular methods for authenticating Rails
applications over the past five years.

The most popular right now is
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) because it makes it
very easy to get up and running quickly. The downside is that the
implementation uses very aggressive Ruby metaprogramming techniques
which make it very challenging to customize.

In the past I’ve been a fan of
[AuthLogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) because it takes a
very straightforward model/view/controller approach, but it means you
have to write a lot of code to get it up and running.

As we learn more about constructing web applications there is a greater
emphasis on decoupling components. It makes a lot of sense to depend on
an external service for our authentication, then that service can serve
this application along with many others.

### Introducing OmniAuth

The best application of this concept is the
[OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth). It’s popular because
it allows you to use multiple third-party services to authenticate, but
it is really a pattern for component-based authentication.

You could let your users login with their Twitter account, but you could
also build your own OmniAuth provider that authenticates all your
company’s apps. Maybe you can use the existing LDAP provider to hook
into ActiveDirectory or OpenLDAP, or make use of the Google Apps
interface?

Better yet, OmniAuth can handle multiple concurrent strategies, so you
can offer users multiple ways to authenticate. Your app is just built
against the OmniAuth interface, those external components can be changed
later.

### Getting Started with OmniAuth

The first step is to add the dependency to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "omniauth-twitter"
```

Then run `bundle` from your terminal.

OmniAuth runs as a “Rack Middleware” which means it’s not really a part
of our app, it’s a thin layer between our app and the client. To
instantiate and control the middleware, we need an initializer. Create a
file `/config/initializers/omniauth.rb` and add the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :twitter, "i0KU4jLYYjWzxpTraWviw", "djMu7QStnBK89MkfIg78tIZ4sFhmGOYjdCjDD0Wsc"
end
```

What is all that garbage? Twitter, like many API-providing services,
wants to track who’s using it. They accomplish this by distributing API
accounts. Specifically, they use the OAuth protocol which requires a
“comsumer key” and a “consumer secret.” If you want to build an
application using the Twitter API you’ll need to [register and get your
own credentials](https://dev.twitter.com/apps). For this tutorial, I’ve
registered a sample application and given you my key/secret above.

### Trying It Out

You need to **restart your server** so the new library and initializer
are picked up. In your browser go to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/twitter` and, after a few seconds, you
should see a Twitter login page. Login to Twitter using any account,
then you should see a **Routing Error** from your application. If you’ve
got that, then things are on the right track.

If you get to this point and encounter a **401 Unauthorized** message
there is more work to do. You’re probably using your own API key and
secret. You need to go into the [settings on Twitter for your
application](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/), and add `http://127.0.0.1`
as a registered callback domain. I also add `http://0.0.0.0` and
`http://localhost` while I’m in there. Now give it a try and you should
get the **Routing Error**

### Handling the Callback

The way this authentication works is that your app redirects to the
third party authenticator, the third party processes the authentication,
then it sends the user back to your application at a “callback URL”.
Twitter is attempting to send the data back to your application, but
your app isn’t listening at the default OmniAuth callback address,
`/auth/twitter/callback`. Let’s add a route to listen for those
requests.

Open `config/routes.rb` and add this line:

```ruby
match '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create', via: :get
```

Re-visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/twitter`, it will process your
already-existing Twitter login, then redirect back to your application
and give you **Uninitialized Constant SessionsController**. Our router
is attempting to call the `create` action of the `SessionsController`,
but that controller doesn’t exist yet.

### Creating a Sessions Controller

Let’s use a generator to create the controller from the command line:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate controller sessions
{% endterminal %}

Then open up that controller and add code so it looks like this:

```ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    render text: request.env["omniauth.auth"]
  end
end
```

Revisit `/auth/twitter` and, once it redirects to your application, you
should see a bunch of information provided by Twitter about the
authenticated user. Now we just need to figure out what to **do** with
all that.

### Creating a User Model

Even though we’re using an external service for authentication, we’ll
still need to keep track of user objects within our system. Let’s create
a model that will be responsible for that data.

As you saw, Twitter gives us a ton of data about the user. What should
we store in our database? The minimum expectations for an OmniAuth
provider are three things:

-   **provider** – A string name uniquely identifying the provider
    service
-   **uid** – An identifying string uniquely identifying the user within
    that provider
-   **name** – Some kind of human-meaningful name for the user

Let’s start with just those three in our model. From your terminal:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate model User provider:string uid:string name:string
{% endterminal %}

Then update the database with `bin/rake db:migrate`.

### Creating Actual Users

How you create users might vary depending on the application. For the
purposes of our shopping cart, we’ll allow anyone to create an account
automatically just by logging in with the third party service.

#### Finding or Creating User Objects

Hop back to the `SessionsController`. I believe strongly that the
controller should have as little code as possible, so we’ll proxy the
User lookup/creation from the controller down to the model like this:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.find_or_create_by_auth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
end
```

Now the `User` model is responsible for figuring out what to do with
that big hash of data from Twitter. We encapsulate the complexity at the
model layer where it’s easy to test an reuse. Open the `User` model and
add this method:

```ruby
def self.find_or_create_by_auth(auth_data)
  find_or_create_by_provider_and_uid_and_name(auth_data["provider"], auth_data["uid"], auth_data["info"]["name"])
end
```

Rails supports dynamic finders. The one we’ve used here is composed of:

-   `find_or_create`
    Attempt to find a match in the database based on the following
    parameters. If found, return it. Otherwise, initialize a new record
    with these values and save it.
-   `_by_provider_and_uid_and_name`
    Do the lookup and initialization using the provider (first
    parameter), the uid (second parameter), and the name (third).

This will work, but it’s fragile. The UID and provider aren’t going to
change, so those are fine. The name might change, though. On Twitter,
for instance, the human-readable name is configurable. If they change
their name on the external service this lookup is going to fail,
creating a second account for them on our service.

Instead, do the lookup with just the fields that won’t change:

```ruby
def self.find_or_create_by_auth(auth_data)
  find_or_create_by_provider_and_uid(auth_data["provider"], auth_data["uid"])
end
```

This is fault-tolerant, but it has an issue. When a user visits our site
for the first time the user object will be created. But we’re now not
utilizing the name at all — so new records won’t have the human name
saved.

Thankfully `find_or_create_by` has a solution. We can add a hash of
parameters that will only be used when creating records, not as part of
the lookup:

```ruby
def self.find_or_create_by_auth(auth_data)
  where(:auth_data ["provider"], :auth_data["uid"],
                                     name: auth_data["info"]["name"]).first_or_create
  end
```

That will work great!

#### Create Action Redirection

Now, back to `SessionsController`, let’s add a redirect action to send
them to the `products_path` after login:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.find_or_create_by_auth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
  session[:user_id] = @user.id
  redirect_to products_path, notice: "Logged in as #{@user.name}"
end
```

Now visit `/auth/twitter` and you should eventually be redirected to
your Products listing and the flash message at the top will show a
message saying that you’re logged in.

### UI for Login/Logout

That’s exciting, but now we need links for login/logout that don’t
require manually manipulating URLs. Anything like login/logout that you
want visible on every page goes in the layout.

Open `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` and you’ll see the
framing for all our view templates. Let’s add in the following **just
below the flash message**:

```erb
<div id="account">
  <% if current_user %>
    <span>Welcome, <%= current_user.name %></span>
    <%= link_to "logout", logout_path, id: "login" %>
  <% else %>
    <%= link_to "login", login_path, id: "logout" %>
  <% end %>
</div>
```

If you refresh your browser that will all crash for several reasons.

### Accessing the Current User

It’s a convention that Rails authentication systems provide a
`current_user` method to access the user. Let’s create that in our
`ApplicationController` with these steps:

-   Underneath the `protect_from_forgery` line, add this:
    `helper_method :current_user`
-   Just before the closing `end` of the class, add this:

```ruby
private
  def current_user
    @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]
  end
```

Even though the `current_user` method is private in
`ApplicationController`, it will be available to all our controllers
because they inherit from `ApplicationController`. In addition, the
`helper_method` line makes the method available to all our views. Now we
can access `current_user` from any controller and any view!

Refresh your page and you’ll move on to the next error,
`` undefined local variable or method `login_path' ``.

### Convenience Routes

Just because we’re following the REST convention doesn’t mean we can’t
also create our own named routes. The view snippet we wrote is
attempting to link to `login_path` and `logout_path`, but our
application doesn’t yet know about those routes.

Open `config/routes.rb` and add two custom routes:

```ruby
match "/login" => redirect("/auth/twitter"), as: :login, via: :get
match "/logout" => "sessions#destroy", as: :logout, via: :get
```

The first line creates a path named `login` which just redirects to the
static address `/auth/twitter` which will be intercepted by the OmniAuth
middleware. The second line creates a `logout` path which will call the
destroy action of our `SessionsController`.

With those in place, refresh your browser and it should load without
error.

We still don't quite get logged in when we click login, though.

We need to set the session variable in the `SessionsController#create` action:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.find_or_create_by_auth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
  session[:user_id] = @user.id
  redirect_to products_path, notice: "Logged in as #{@user.name}"
end
```

### Implementing Logout

Our login works great, but we can’t logout. When you click the logout
link it’s attempting to call the `destroy` action of
`SessionsController`. Let’s implement that.

-   Open `SessionsController`
-   Add a `destroy` method
-   In the method, erase the session marker by setting
    `session[:user_id] = nil`
-   Redirect them to the `root_path` with the notice `"Goodbye!"`
-   Define a `root_path` in your router like this:
    `root to: "products#index"`

Now try logging out and you’ll be taken to the products index page.

### Connecting Users to Orders

We’ve done the hard work of creating `User` objects and logging them
into the system. Now we need to tie orders to users.

#### Connecting the Order to a User

Open the `Order` model and add a new `belongs_to` line:

```ruby
belongs_to :user
```

#### Connecting the User to Orders

Then in the `User` model, just add `has_many :orders`

### User/Order Workflow

Now we need to figure out when in the lifecycle we can connect a `User`
and an `Order`

1.  When an order is created, connect them to the current user if one is
    logged in
2.  When they login, connect them to the current order

#### Displaying the User on the Order

Let’s output the associated `User` on the order’s `show` page. There’s
already a TH for “Customer”, just add this into the TD:

```erb
<td><%= @order.user.name if @order.user %></td>
```

#### When an Order is Created

Our orders are created in the `load_order` method in
`OrderItemsController`. Let’s modify it to associate a new order with the
current user, if one is logged in:

```ruby
def load_order
  @order = Order.find_or_initialize_by_id(session[:order_id],
                                            status: "unsubmitted", user_id: session[:user_id])
  if @order.new_record?
    @order.save!
    session[:order_id] = @order.id
  end
end
```

#### When an Order Exists **before** They Login

Open up the `SessionsController`. The `create` action is what logs them
in. Once the `User` is known we can look for an existing order and, if
there is one, connect it to the `User`:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.find_or_create_by_auth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
  session[:user_id] = @user.id
  load_order
  @order.update_attributes(user: @user)
  redirect_to products_path, notice: "Logged in as #{@user.name}"
end
```

Test it by logging out, adding a product to your cart, and then logging in.

It blows up, because it doesn't know about `load_order`.

If we move `load_order` into the `ApplicationController` it will be accessible
to both the OrderItemsController and the SessionsController.

#### Clear the Order on Logout

As long as we’re in the `SessionsController`, let’s clear the order from
the session when they logout like this:

```ruby
def destroy
  session[:user_id] = nil
  session[:order_id] = nil
  redirect_to root_path
end
```

#### Test It!

Now you should be all set. Try creating orders when you’re not logged
in, then login and the order is preserved. Login first, then create an
order and it’s connected to your account.

## Iteration 7: Checkout

We’ve got a decent shopping experience going — except you can’t actually
place the order.

Let’s build the ability to add a shipping address and “submit” the
order. We won’t actually integrate with a payment gateway, but can point
out along the way where that would happen.

### Building Addresses

A user might ship different orders to different places, so the address
needs to be associated with the order. But, at the same time, our
frequent customers don’t want to enter in the same address every time.

#### Designing the Data Relationships

The solution? We’ll build an address model that is tied to a user. When
the user submits the order, they’ll pick one of their addresses or add a
new one. The order will then be connected to that address.

From a model/database perspective:

-   A `User` will have many `Addresses`
-   An `Address` will belong to a `User`
-   An `Order` will belong to an `Address`
-   An `Address` will have many `Orders`

The `belongs_to` side of a relationship holds the foreign key. So we see
that `Address` needs a foreign key `user_id` and the `Order` needs an
`address_id`.

#### The Address Model

We know that it’ll need a `user_id`, but what else goes into a US
address?

-   Street Number & Street Name (“Line 1”)
-   Apartment / Suite (“Line 2”)
-   City
-   State
-   Zipcode

All those fields can be stored as strings. Let’s use the scaffold generator, even though we won’t use all the parts:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate scaffold Address line1:string line2:string city:string state:string zip:string user_id:integer
$ bin/rake db:migrate
{% endterminal %}

#### Validating Addresses

Everything except `line2` should be required in an address. Let’s assume
that the zipcode should be exactly 5 characters that are only digits.
The `state` must be a two-letter uppercase abbreviation.

Add validations that protect each of these requirements. Look here for
tips: [Rails Guide on
Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

#### Modifying the Orders Table

We also need to add that `address_id` foreign key to the orders table.
That means creating a migration.

When you generate a migration to add a column to an existing database
you can do everything from the command line if you follow the
convention. It goes like this:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate migration add_[name]_to_[table] [column_name]:[column_type]
{% endterminal %}

So in this case:

{% terminal %}
$ bin/rails generate migration add_address_id_to_orders address_id:integer
$ bin/rake db:migrate
{% endterminal %}

Our database is setup, but there is a lot more to do!

#### Setting Relationships

Open the `Order`, `User`, and `Address` models. Add the relationships we
described above.

### Checkout UI

Log in, go to the products page, and add something to your cart.

When a user is on the order page they should be able to select an
existing address from a drop-down list of their associated addresses or
click a link to add a new address.

#### Building Addresses in the Console

Let’s create two sample addresses for your current user in the console.
Here’s how you might do that:

{% irb %}
$ a = User.last.addresses.build(line1: "123 First Street", line2: "Suite B", city: "Washington", state: "DC", zip: "20011")
$ a.save
$ b = User.last.addresses.build(line1: "321 Second Street", city: "Arlington", state: "VA", zip: "22182")
$ b.save
{% endirb %}

#### Wrapping the Order in a Form

Open `app/views/orders/show.html.erb` and add another row to the end of
the table like this:

```erb
<tr>
  <th>Shipping To:</th>
  <td>
    (addresses select box)
    (add an address link)
  </td>
</tr>
```

To have a select box and, eventually, a “submit” button we’ll need a
form. The best approach is probably to enclose the entire table in the
form tags. Up above the table opening tag, add a `form_for` like this:

```erb
<%= form_for @order do |f| %>
```

Then put a matching `end` at the bottom of the template.

#### Displaying Addresses on the Order

Now to figure out that select. Creating select boxes in Rails has always
seemed unnecessarily difficult.

We’ll use the form helper `select`. It expects as parameters the name of
the attribute being set, here `address_id` then an array of options.
Each of those options should be a two element array where the first
element is the name to show on the form and the second is the value to
submit. In this case, we want:

```erb
<%= f.select :address_id, current_user.addresses.collect{|a| [a.to_s, a.id]} %>
```

The options here are built by grabbing all the current user’s addresses
and creating an array made up of arrays containing the address converted
to a string (`to_s`) and the `id`.

Load it in your browser and you should see something like
`#<Address:0x0000028394482` in the select box. This is actually good!

#### Implementing the `to_s`

There are a few ways we could format the address for presentation in the
select box, but the easiest is to define `to_s` in the model. Whenever
you see that format like `#<ClassName:0x00002838203` you’re looking at a
model that doesn’t implement `to_s`, but `to_s` is being called on it
anyway. This implementation of `to_s` comes from Ruby’s `Object`, the
parent of all objects.

Let’s implement a better `to_s` in the `Address` model. Define the
method, build an array of the attributes you want to display, then join
them together with a comma and a space.

If you have sample addresses without a “Line 2”, you’ll see an extra
comma in the output. You can remove `nil` or empty string entries with
this method call: `compact` on the array of attributes.

#### Adding Addresses

Now let’s build out that “add an address” link. You can handle this on
your own, here are the steps:

-   Write a `link_to` that points to the `new_address_path`
-   In the `new` action of `AddressesController`, use `current_user` to
    build the new object
-   On the form, make the `user_id` field hidden
-   If the `save` succeeds, redirect back to the order.

#### Submitting the Order

We can pick an address, but we can’t submit the order. Add another row
to the table that includes a submit button like this:

```erb
<%= f.submit "Submit Order" %>
```

View it in your browser, click the button, and look at the log file from
your server.

You’ll see that it got a PATCH request to `"/orders/1"`, and that it gets
processed by the OrdersController#update action.

The action succeeds, but there's a warning in the log file:

```plain
Unpermitted parameters: address_id
```

We'd like to include `address_id` in the list of permitted order_params at the
bottom of the `orders_controller.rb` file:

```ruby
def order_params
  params.require(:order).permit(:user_id, :status, :address_id)
end
```

#### Changing the Order Status

```ruby
def update
  respond_to do |format|
    if @order.update(order_params.merge(status: 'submitted'))
      # ...
    else
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

#### Cleaning Up

After updating the order, remove order_id from the session so they can't edit
it:

```ruby
session[:order_id] = nil
```

#### Redirect to Confirmation Page

Lastly, we want to redirect to a thank you page with an order summary.

```ruby
format.html { redirect_to confirm_order_path(@order) }
```

If you submit an order, you'll get an
``undefined local variable or method `confirm_order_path'`` error.

Open up `config/routes.rb` and update the resources for orders:

```ruby
resources :orders do
  member do
    get :confirm
  end
end
```

Create an empty action in `OrdersController` called `confirm`. It is going to
need to get the order, so add `:confirm` to the `before_action` for
`set_order` at the top of the file.

Create a template in `app/views/orders/confirm.html.erb`.

Go ahead and flesh that page out.

#### It Should Work!

You should now be able to submit and order. Iteration 7 is complete!

## Next Steps

Here are some extension ideas:

-   Add authorization so only administrators can add or change product
    information
-   Create an admin interface for viewing and modifying all orders
-   Create a `/profile` page where a user can view/change their
    information and past orders
-   Let users pick a default shipping address
-   Add a billing address that uses the same set of user addresses
